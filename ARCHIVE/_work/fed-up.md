[Fed-Up](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-cdd) (a.k.a generator-cdd) is a lightweight CSS/SCSS BEM-framework and yeoman generator for team collaboration.

Working in a team with other developers you'll quickly realize a set of rules is required to ensure everyone codes in the same style.

Along with [@tomrichards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-richards-5a95157) I spent a lot of time combining our previous experiences with the numerous existing approaches out there and combined our favourites.

The goal of Fed-Up isn't to reinvent the wheel. Some clever people have already solved these problems.

> Fed-Up is a collection of best practices and guidelines, along with a base SASS system to kickstart new projects.


### Main Objectives:

- Enforce coding standards in a mixed team
- Provide a clear methodology for CSS architecture
- Enforce modular approach using BEM
- Provide a "core" setup that all projects will share
- Provide easy-to-use generators for creating new projects and modules

### What it's not:

- It's not bootstrap
- It doesn't come with ANY premade modules

In it's essence It's a folder structure, a grid system, a breakpoint system and some typograpy helpers.

This is combined with a yeoman generator (generator-cdd) that does the laborious tasks for you.

[The generator is available here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-cdd).
