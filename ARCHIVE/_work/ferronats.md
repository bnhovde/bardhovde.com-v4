A month or so ago I was lucky enough to do my first "real" public talk at [Digital Hampshire](http://www.digitalhampshire.com/) along with my colleague, [Carl Cahill](https://medium.com/@carl_cahill).

The talk was about an internal project, and we wanted to share the approach and lessons learned.

Having both the creative and the tech approach I think worked quite well. Carl covered the creative approach and content creation and I talked around the code behind it.

In my part of the talk I covered the basics of animation in the browser. I tried to give an insight into the inner workings without getting too techincal.

For anyone interested in doing a talk, the below tips helped me a lot. They’re not revolutionary in any way but would still be my advice to anyone about to do their first talk.

### 1: Practice runs

Practice your talk in it’s entirety at least two times beforehand. Find someone that can listen. A couple of colleagues. Your partner. Anyone! 

Make sure you do so with the slides on a screen, memorising the slide order is a good idea. Use these practice runs to get feedback and make notes (bring a notebook), then tweak your talk afterwards.

### 2: More practice runs

A couple of days before the talk I was freaking out a little. I had the material ready but not the words. Since I had roughly memorised What I found to be a great help was to internally rehearse my talk from start to finish while i was doing mundane tasks. In the shower, walking to work, at the gym, making dinner.

> Even if you’ll forget certain things from these rehearsals, most of it will stick, and you won’t have to spend time searching for words during the talk.

### 3: Good slides

Having effective slides took a lot of pressure off us. Don’t cram your slides full of words, but use illustrations, key words and figures that you can then elaborate on. The slides are your cue cards, but you don’t want to be stood facing the screen and reading them aloud.

### 4: Question time

The dreaded question time. This was relatively painless for us. Make sure you know your material and you’re in a good place. If a question still trips you up, just say you’ll get back to the person after the talk to discuss.

### Summary

Try to relax. If you have prepared, once you start talking you’ll be on autopilot anyway.

At the end of the day, remember that you’re putting yourself out there for something you’re passionate about. What’s the worst thing that could happen?
