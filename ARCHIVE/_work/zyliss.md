[Zyliss easy-pull](http://zylisseasypull.co.uk) is a web microsite developed at [@cddnation](). Designed by [@josscook]() and built by me.

It's a one page microsite for the Zyliss EasyPull food processor. An interactive user experience that demonstrates how to use the new Zyliss EasyPull.

### Challenges:

Having learned a lot about browser performance in a [similar job](/work/ferronats/) previously I was able to utilise this knowledge here.

The site is built ground-up with performance in mind, with the goal of a constant 60FPS experience.

> There is very little repainting going on, which should make the scrolling seem smooth and seamless.

The site is responsive and should run on any browser down to IE9, but laptop/desktop users were the target audience for this campaign.
