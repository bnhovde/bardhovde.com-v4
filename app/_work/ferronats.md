A month or so ago I was lucky enough to do my first "real" public talk at [Digital Hampshire](http://www.digitalhampshire.com/) along with my colleague, [Carl Cahill](https://medium.com/@carl_cahill).

The talk was about an internal project, and we wanted to share the approach and lessons learned.

Having both the creative and the tech approach I think worked quite well. Carl covered the creative approach and content creation and I talked around the code behind it.
