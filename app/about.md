#About.

Originally from Norway I moved to the UK after finishing my education. Wanting to become a web-designer I managed to get a role in a creative web team in <a href="https://www.oldmutualwealth.co.uk/">Old Mutual Wealth</a>.

Shortly after I found that code makes more sense to me. I was lucky enough to work in a flexible team that promoted personal progression, and so I moved into a developer role.

Since then I've been lucky enough to work in a series of dev teams, from .NET environments to my current role at <a href="http://cddnation.com">cdd</a>.

My areas of interest and experience are always changing, but currently they are as follows:
