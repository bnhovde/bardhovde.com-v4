#About.

Originally from Norway I moved to the UK after finishing my education. Wanting to become a web-designer I managed to get a role in a creative web team in <a href="https://www.oldmutualwealth.co.uk/">Old Mutual Wealth</a>.

Shortly after I found that code makes more sense to me. I was lucky enough to work in a flexible team that promoted personal progression, and so I moved into a developer role.

> I've found that having experience in design has helped me a lot when building UI's as well as reasoning about functionality.

Since then I've been lucky enough to work with some very skilled people across multiple dev teams, from .NET environments to my current role of Senior Front-End Developer at <a href="http://cddnation.com">cdd</a>.
